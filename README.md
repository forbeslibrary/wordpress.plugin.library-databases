Wordpress Plugin: Library Databases
===========

This is a Wordpress plugin for a library wishing to provide easy access to and
organization of library databases and other electronic resources on the web.

This software is maintained by Forbes Library. At this time there are few
options and much that is specific to the library has been hard coded. We hope to
make it more configurable in future versions.
