- Postfix is currently only used to add "with bpl card" to database names in
  select menu. This is not documented. Is this the right tool? If so,
  document it. If not, fix it.
- Figure out why databases sometimes styled strangely (unexpected width and alignment)
- make sure all function names are descriptive
- make lists of tests
- make sure all ids are ints using intval to avoid errors
- make sure all database queries return a sane number of results
